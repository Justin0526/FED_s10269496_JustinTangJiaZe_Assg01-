<h1> Project Z </h1>
<p> 
This website serves as a resource for anyone interested in learning to swim. It caters to a significant age gap that includes children as young as four and up to elderly individuals of any age. It aims to encourage people of all ages and abilities to take up swimming, whether they are beginners or fear the water. The website includes classes on everything from fundamentals of swimming to advanced competitive swimming. It encourages and motivates people to overcome personal challenges and break their limits.  

The primary purpose of this website is to demystify swimming and make it approachable for everyone. It achieves this by assuring the audience with a promising professional and friendly team of coaches to create a supportive and inspiring environment. The website motivates and encourages the user to take up the first step, empowering them to set personal goals and ultimately enjoy the sport of swimming!

In the future, we hope to save potential customers' time, we are planning to implement a one-stop service for their swimming needs. It offers gear and equipment, from the basics of learning to swim to training gear and competitive gear and accessories, all chosen wisely and ideally, simplifying the process of users consulting multiple sources to find only the gear they need. 

By offering this all-inclusive service, the website caters to those who want to learn to swim or even train but may feel uncertain about where to begin, ensuring a seamless, supportive journey into the sport.
</p>

<h2> Design Process </h2>

This include children as young as four, adults that have phobia for water and elderly who want to remain active. They may have diverse goals, such as overcoming a fear, breaking through themselves or even just treating it a simple exercise. The primary users include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>As a parent, I want to search for swimming lessons for my children. (Mainly for water safety)</li>
<li>As an adult, I want to improve my swimming skills, learn to swim because of an injury, or overcoming my fear for the water or even just as simple as exercising. </li>
<li>As a senior citizen, I want to exercise my whole body but I don't want the to burden my joints too much</li>
<li>As a competitive swimmer, I want to refine my swimming techniques and break my PBs.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Achknowledgements </h3>
<p>
I received inspiration for this project from my ex-swimming academy. A place that I've been since the end of the year since 7 years old. I have learn to swim, trained extensively and even worked as a swimming coach in the swimming academy in Malaysia, Johor, Kluang, until I arrived at Singapore to further my studies. Because The academy being local to the town where I'm from, played a significant role in shaping my skills and passion for swimming. This project is my attempt to test my abilities and build a website with what I've learnt to further promote the swimming academy. 
</p>
<em> Ps ~ This is not a website revamp, The academy does not currently have a website, and the name used here is also fictional. 
</em>
